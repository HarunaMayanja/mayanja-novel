<section>
    <h2>Act 1: The Hard Edge</h2>
    <h3>Scene 1: The Café, The Hard Guy</h3>
    <p>Haruna Mayanja is the kind of guy who never looks up. The kind who keeps his head down, a permanent frown on his face, and a hardened look in his eyes. At 26, he’s been through enough to know that the world doesn’t owe him anything, and it’s best not to expect much from anyone. He’s tough, detached, and cynical—a man who’s built walls so high, no one can see past them.</p>
    
    <p>He sits at the same corner table in a local café in Kampala, the one by the window, sipping his black coffee in silence. The café is filled with chatter, the clink of cups, and the low hum of music in the background. But Haruna doesn’t care about the noise. He never does. He’s a man of few words, preferring to observe from his corner, the quiet observer in a world that spins too fast for him to care about.</p>

    <p>He doesn't believe in love. Not anymore. He’s seen too much heartache, too many people burn their lives away chasing after something that doesn’t exist. His father, a broken man who tried and failed to make a family work. His mother, who moved on, never looking back. Love, in Haruna's mind, is nothing more than an illusion—a fantasy that people tell themselves to get through the day.</p>
    
    <p>He’s used to being alone. Alone, with his thoughts, his ambitions, and the harsh reality he’s carved for himself. He keeps the world at arm’s length, because it’s easier that way. No attachments, no disappointments. That’s the rule.</p>

        "Love’s for fools. I’ll make my own way. I don’t need anyone."

    <h2>Act 2: A Distraction Called Emma</h2>
    <h3>Scene 1: The Intruder</h3>
    <p>But then, one rainy afternoon, everything changes. The door to the café opens, and in steps a woman, drenched from the rain. Haruna doesn’t even look up at first. He’s seen it all before—people rushing in to escape the storm, their lives full of drama and noise.</p>

    <p>But then she does something unexpected. She takes a seat at the table across from him, pulling out a notebook and a camera from her bag. Her name is <strong>Emma</strong>, a photographer new to Kampala, full of stories about the beauty she captures through her lens. She doesn’t notice Haruna at first—at least, that’s what he tells himself. She’s too busy scribbling in her notebook, her eyes lighting up as she talks to the barista about the places she’s been.</p>

    <p>Haruna remains silent, his coffee growing colder as he watches her from the corner of his eye. She talks too much, laughs too loud, and there’s something about the way she speaks about life—about passion—that makes him uncomfortable. He doesn’t want to care. He doesn’t want to be sucked into this whirlwind of emotions that people like her bring with them.</p>

    <p>Still, he can’t help but notice her eyes. They’re full of fire, of something real that Haruna doesn’t understand but feels drawn to nonetheless. She doesn’t seem to care about him, which is probably for the best. The last thing he needs is someone like her trying to break through the tough exterior he’s worked so hard to build.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        "Stay out of my head, Emma. I don’t need your distractions."

    <h2>Act 3: The Struggle</h2>
    <h3>Scene 1: Pulling Away</h3>
    <p>As the days pass, Emma becomes a regular at the café, sitting at the same table, working on her projects. She talks to him occasionally—about her photography, her travels, her latest project—but Haruna remains distant. He doesn’t engage with her. He doesn’t ask questions. He keeps his emotions locked down tight. But the more he tries to ignore her, the more he finds himself thinking about her.</p>

    <p>Her energy, her optimism—it grates against everything he believes in. How can someone like her live with that much hope? How can she be so... open? Haruna is not like that. He’s been burned too many times, and he’s learned that the only thing that matters is survival. Everyone else can fend for themselves.</p>

    <p>But Emma doesn’t let him stay in his shell. One day, she invites him to one of her photography exhibitions. He refuses at first. He doesn’t need to be part of her world, doesn’t need to indulge her fantasy of capturing “moments of love.” But something in her smile, that stubborn look in her eyes, makes him say yes. He shows up, not because he’s interested, but because he feels some strange pull he can’t explain.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        "I’m not here for love, Emma. But I’m here for you. Whatever that means."
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Scene 2: The Heartbreak of Realization</h3>
    <p>At the exhibition, Haruna’s world tilts on its axis. He’s always told himself that love doesn’t exist, that it’s a lie. But the photos she’s taken—these moments of raw emotion—make him question everything he’s believed. They’re not just pictures; they’re stories, deep and meaningful. Each frame holds a connection between two people, a bond he’s never allowed himself to experience.</p>

    <p>Emma catches him looking at one of the photos. It’s a shot of two people holding hands in the rain, smiling despite the storm. He doesn’t know why, but it hits him hard. His chest tightens, a knot of emotion he’s been avoiding for years. He doesn’t want to feel this. Not now. Not ever.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote">
        "You don’t have to pretend with me, Haruna. I see it in your eyes. You’re not as tough as you think."
    </blockquote>

    <p>But he’s not ready. He walks away. Leaves the exhibition early, telling himself it’s just a picture. Just a moment in time. Love is still a lie. And yet... it’s harder to convince himself this time.</p>

    <h2>Act 4: The Realization</h2>
    <h3>Scene 1: The Return</h3>
    <p>Weeks pass. Haruna goes back to his routine—work, study, coffee. But Emma’s words echo in his mind. He can’t shake the feeling that he’s been running from something real. He’s spent his life building walls, keeping everyone out, but in doing so, he’s isolated himself in a cage of his own making.</p>

    <p>One day, Haruna walks into the café, and Emma is sitting there, just as always, her camera in hand. This time, something is different. He’s different. He takes a seat at her table. No words, just the
